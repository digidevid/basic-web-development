            <p class="z-20 px-7 pt-3 text-gray-300">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="px-3 pb-3 text-gray-300">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> structure from
            professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former
            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff
            did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
            project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial
            could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent
            experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.
            100% recommend!</p>
